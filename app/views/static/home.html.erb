      Party for Humanity is a non-profit organization that lets you celebrate by having party guests give to a charity of your choice.
    </p>
		<p>
      Whether it's a first birthday, a sweet sixteen, a graduation, or a bar/bat mitzvah, there's always an occasion to share your joy with a good cause.
    </p>
		<p>
      Party for Humanity makes it easy to organize donations instead of having guests spend money on a gift.
    </p>
		<p>
      There are no fees through Party for Humanity. <b class="emphasis">All</b> of your donations go directly to the charity you choose. We have no spam, no advertising, no pop-ups. We do not sell or share your names or your party lists.
